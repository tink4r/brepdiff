# 🏋️ Training

We provide preprocessed datasets and training scripts to reproduce the results in the paper.

## 📦 Dataset Preparation

Download the dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pM2SU0p6nNdW_c4z2bgtnKsnyCsI2gKm?usp=drive_link) and place it under the following directory structure:
```angular2html
{project_root}/
├── src/
├── data/
│ └── abc_processed/
│ ├── v1_1_grid8.h5
│ ├── deepcad_30_train.txt
│ ├── deepcad_30_val.txt
│ ├── deepcad_30_test.txt
│ ├── deepcad_30_pkl_absence.txt
│ ├── abc_50_train.txt
│ ├── abc_50_val.txt
│ ├── abc_50_test.txt
│ └── abc_50_pkl_absence.txt
└── ...
```

- `deepcad_30_*` contains the train/val/test splits for the DeepCAD dataset.
- `abc_50_*` contains the splits for the ABC 50-face subset.
- The `*_pkl_absence.txt` files list missing samples relative to BrepGen. For the DeepCAD dataset, this should be empty,  so do not worry about it.

Looking to run quick overfitting experiments on your own STEP parts? Follow the dedicated walkthrough in [🔧 Overfitting BrepDiff on Custom STEP Data](docs/custom_overfit.md).

## 🚀 Training

We recommend the following hardware configurations:

### 🔹 DeepCAD dataset (2 × 24GB GPUs)
```bash
python scripts/run.py logs/brepdiff/deepcad --config-path configs/deepcad.yaml
```
Expected training time: ~4 days with 2×NVIDIA 3090 (24GB) GPUs.

### 🔹 ABC 50-face dataset (4 × 48GB GPUs)
```bash
python scripts/run.py logs/brepdiff/abc --config-path configs/abc.yaml
```
Expected training time: ~7 days with 4×NVIDIA A6000 (48GB) GPUs.


Add the `--debug` flag to quickly verify that training runs correctly.
By default, Weights & Biases (W&B) logging is enabled.
Use the `--wandb-offline` flag to disable W&B logging.

## 🧯 Troubleshooting
### ❌ ValueError: current limit exceeds maximum limit
You may see an error like this:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "scripts/run.py", line 18, in <module>
    resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_NOFILE, (8192, rlimit[1]))
ValueError: current limit exceeds maximum limit
```

This means your system’s file descriptor soft limit is too high.
To resolve it, lower the value in `scripts/run.py`:
```
# Before:
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_NOFILE, (8192, rlimit[1]))

# After:
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_NOFILE, (1024, rlimit[1]))
```
